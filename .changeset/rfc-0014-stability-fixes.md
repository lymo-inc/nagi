Consumer-driven stability fixes (RFC 0014):

- **N1 (pgmq)** — internal queue SQL now strips Kysely plugins so consumer-installed transformers (e.g. `CamelCasePlugin`) can't break receipt reads. Fixes silent-ack failures when the caller's `db` has CamelCasePlugin installed; the workaround (`db.withoutPlugins()` at the consumer) is no longer required.

- **N3 + N4 (core)** — new `wf.describe(runId)` returns a typed projection `{run: RunView, steps: StepView[]}` covering parent/child links + step lease state, replacing direct `nagi.workflow_run` / `nagi.step_run` table reads. New `RunId.parse(s)` / `RunId.fromTrusted(s)` constructors retire the `as RunId` cast.

- **N5 (core + postgres)** — new `wf.startStaged(flow, input, { tx, runId? })` enqueues a run inside the caller's Kysely tx. Returns `{ runId, started, canceled, applyOnCommit }`; the caller commits their tx, then awaits `applyOnCommit()` to fire cancellation hooks. Skips the concurrency advisory lock under shared tx (relies on the partial unique index); retries once on unique-violation, then throws `NagiConcurrencyConflictError`. Retires the consumer-side `pending_workflow_run` + reconciler outbox pattern. `wf.start` and `Store.tryStartRun` are unchanged.

- **N7 audit pins (core)** — 8 tests proving `decideSignal` correctly buffers signals across `pending` / `running` / `backoff` / `aborting` states. No code change; pins the invariant ahead of N8.

- **N8 (core + postgres) — load-bearing reliability fix.** New lease autoreaper detects expired leases on non-terminal steps, deletes the lease, writes a `lease.reaped` audit fact, and re-enqueues the step at `attempt + 1` — all atomically. Heartbeat now extends both queue VT AND store lease per tick. Periodic reaper loop is built into `nagi.run` (configurable `NagiConfig.reaperIntervalMs`, default 30s; `0` disables). Resolves the steady-state stuck-run failure mode where a dead worker stranded steps indefinitely. Resolves RFC 0013 Open Question 3.

- **N9 (core)** — new `NagiFlowSnapshotGoneError` thrown at dispatch when the run's pinned `flowHash` ≠ current registry's hash for that `flowId`. Replaces silent code-version drift with a typed, catchable error. `wf.cancel` and `wf.signal` bypass the hash check (fact-only paths).

- **N10 (core)** — handler-thrown `NagiCanceledError` now reclassifies the run as `flow.canceled` (cause: `concurrency`), not `flow.failed`. `workflow_run.canceled_by_run_id` populates from the canonical fact, not from the error JSONB. Closes the LYMO-12P false-positive watchdog alert class. Walks the error cause chain via `instanceof` (defends against forged JSONB).

- **N12 (core)** — `NagiAbortError.name = "AbortError"` (WHATWG conformance). Run-vs-step discriminator moved from `scope` to `kind`. Class exported from `@nagi-js/core` for typed consumer-side translation. Fetch-based SDKs (`@ai-sdk/provider-utils`, OpenRouter) now correctly recognize nagi-originated aborts via the standard `isAbortError` allowlist — no more Sentry spam / wasted LLM retries when a watchdog fires mid-call.

N11 (phantom superseder, 1-in-53 frequency in consumer data) is deferred to a follow-up RFC pending root-cause investigation. N2 (CHANGELOG/README) and N6 (multi-name buffering — already correct in rc.12) intentionally not addressed.
